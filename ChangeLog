msktutil 0.4:

Changes since msktutil_0.3.16-7 downloaded from:
  http://download.systemimager.org/~finley/msktutil/

- James Y Knight took over maintainance.

- Made most functionality work properly with only the machine account
  credentials.

- Adds COMPUTERNAME$ to the keytab, and authenticates with that, so
  that setting userPrincipalName to host/COMPUTERNAME.DOMAIN@REALM
  isn't necessary. (since userPrincipalName isn't settable without
  admin perms)

- Now attempts to authenticate with the default machine account
  password so that AD "reset account" is functional.

- Gets the default LDAP OU to create new machines in from the magic
  GUID from AD, instead of assuming CN=Computers.

- Added --precreate option to allow an administrator to script
  creation of accounts without touching a local keytab.

- Added --auto-update for use from a crontab to auto-rotate password.

- No longer attempts to disable password expiry by default: So note,
  you need to either run --auto-update from cron or else pass the
  (new) argument --dont-expire-password when creating the account.

- Added --remove-service argument.

- Fixed old kvno expiration policy so that it keeps old principals
   around in the keytab for a week, instead of just keeping the
   immediately-prior kvno.

- Switched languages from C to C++.

- Lots of other cleanup and various bugfixes.

- Removed --des-only option, you can use --supportedEncryptionTypes if
  you really want to use single DES. (which, of course, you shouldn't,
  given that it's now 2010 and Single DES was known to be utterly
  broken for over 10 years by now!)
