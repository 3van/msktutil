  * James Y Knight took over maintainance.
  * Made everything that can work properly with only the machine account
    credentials.
  * Attempts to authenticate with the default machine account password so
    that AD "reset account" is functional.
  * Get default LDAP OU to create new machines in from the magic GUID from
    AD, instead of assuming CN=Computers.
  * Added --precreate option to allow an administrator to script creation
    of accounts.
  * Added --auto-update for use from a crontab to auto-rotate password.
  * No longer attempts to disable password expiry by default: so note, you
    need to either run --auto-update from cron or else pass the (new)
    argument --dont-expire-password.
  * Added --remove-service argument.
  * Fixed old kvno expiration policy so that it keeps old principals
    around in the keytab for a week, instead of just keeping the
    immediately-prior kvno.
  * Switched languages from C to C++.
  * Lots of other cleanup and various minor bugs.
