 Installing

To install msktutil, you'll need to unpack the source.   I'm guessing you've
gotten this far if you're reading this file :-)

Msktutil uses a standard autoconf system to build...  Just run './configure' 
followed by 'make' and (as root) 'make install'.   Note that in order to 
build this you will need development headers and libraries for MIT Kerberos,
LDAP, and SASL.  If these packages are installed elsewhere, you can use the
following options to the configure script:

   --with-krb5dir=/path/to/kerberos
   --with-ldapdir=/path/to/ldap
   --with-sasldir=/path/to/sasl

Note the pathes specified are expected to a base path.  For example, the 
configure script expects that an 'include' and 'lib' directory exists in 
each of the base pathes with the appropriate headers and libraries.  You 
also can set the LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS enviroment variables to specify other 
paths for these headers and libraries.



 Portability

This code has been tested under Linux, (specifically RedHat) using OpenLDAP
2.2.10+, CMU SASL 2, and MIT Kerberos 1.3.0+.  This code may work correctly 
with other combinations of software versions, but it hasn't been tested. If 
you get this code to work on other platforms and in other LDAP/Kerberos 
environments, send me an email letting me know about your success.  Likewise,
I'm happy to take suggests on how to make the code more portable.
