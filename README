Msktutil is a program for interoperability with Active Directory that can:
 - Create a computer account in Active Directory
 - Create a system Kerberos keytab
 - Add and remove principals to and from that keytab
 - Change the computer account's password

See the man page for more information on how to use it.

This package has been through a few maintainers over the years.

It was originally written by Dan Perry, and available from
<http://www.pppl.gov/~dperry/>

Then, it was downloaded from there and debianized by Brian Elliott
Finley in Mar 2006.

Then, Doug Engbert made a number of changes to it during 2009.

Then, in Feb 2010, James Knight then downloaded the debian package with
changes from <http://download.systemimager.org/~finley/msktutil/>, and
made even more changes. That's what you have now. :)
